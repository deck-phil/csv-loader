# csv-loader
--System Information--

I wrote this project on Windows 10 Version 1709 OS Build 16299.371. This project should be able to run on any operating system with no issues.

--Programming Language and Dependencies--

This project is entirely written in Python 3.6.4. With the exception of the imported and exports files which are CSV. These files are generated by the application or others and should not have to be edited. The recent import files are kept in a JSON file within the source folder (This file holds the information to quickly import a dataset again). Again, this file is generated by the application, no need to touch this. This application works with MySQL database, and so, you must have MySQL 5.7 for it to work properly.

Since the most recent version of the MySQL connector for Python is outdated I used a third-party connector. This is an updated version of the original MySQL connector that works with Python 3.6.4. The syntax for this should be the same for the original MySQL connector, if ever it gets updated, it should still work with no issues. For unit testing I used PyTest. This made unit testing a lot more comprehensive and know where you went wrong.

If you have pip installed, you may install this dependency by opening the console and typing:
pip install mysqlclient

--IDE--

To work on this project, you may use any IDE that supports Python. I personally used Eclipse with the PyDev plugin. To install this plugin, I followed a guide since it can be tricky to getting working correctly. I also used the PyLint plugin to tidy up my code along the way.

--Getting Started--

All source files are located in the src folder. There is an example CSV file in the folder as well. The recent imports JSON file is located in the src folder.

To start editing files simply open up any of them in the IDE of your choice and begin. To run the application, run the launcher.py file.

--Things You Should Know--

I structured this application in the following way. The datasource and filesource classes handle database connections and csv files respectively. Both of the files are used by csvloader class to handle importing, exporting and data manipulation. The window class uses an instance of csvloader and adds a GUI interface to let the client interact with the csvloader. Both csvalertdialog and csvinputdialog are used by the window class to input information and display alerts. The jsonloader class isn’t nested in the csvloader class, but rather used in the window class to help with the recent imports menu item.

The data is store in a csvloader instance, more specifically, the csvloader.data variable, with the header (columns) stored in csvloader.header.
